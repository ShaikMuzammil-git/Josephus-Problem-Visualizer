# Josephus-Problem-Visualizer
This React Project will give a visual resresentaion of working of the Josephus Problem statement

---------------------------

I had once asked "chatGPT" to build me a visualizer (in HTML , CSS , JavaScript) for the Josephus Problem (DSA coding) & despite me giving many clear instructions on how to make it to make -> chatGPT couldnt make me a fully working visualizer

I decided to make one for myself using ReactJS , because it would be a good revision React Hooks + building visualizers is always fun :)
